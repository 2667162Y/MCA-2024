  <h1>Week[1]</h1>
  
  <p>[Task 2: My choice in Week 1 is Jingle Bell. It is one of the most frequently sung Christmas songs in the world. The song was written by Lord James Pierpont in 1850 at Simpson's Tavern in Medford, Massachusetts It was published in September 1857 under the title One Horse Open Sleigh. It was first recorded on an Edison cylinder in 1889; this record, thought to be the first Christmas record, is now lost, but an 1898 record-also on the Edison Record Company-survives. It is claimed that the song was originally composed to be sung for the Sunday school choir on Thanksgiving Day or as a drinking song. I chose this piece of music as my theme because I grew up playing it to hearing it so often, and every time I heard it I got the feeling of family reunion, so I thought my first music-related job could relate to it.]</p>

  <p>[Task 3: Challenge At this early stage, the main problem I'm finding is access issues. The score in particular is quite old, plus the piece is a bit difficult therefore there are many problems when converting to editable mode, such as missing notes or notes that are very different from the original, which will need to be corrected at a later stage. So I'm concerned about whether the final product will match the original]</p>
