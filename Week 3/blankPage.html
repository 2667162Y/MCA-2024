  <h2>Comparison</h2>
  
  <pre>
Time Signature
MusicXML
In MusicXML，the beat number is represented in the <time> element, the number of beats per measure is represented by <beats> and the time value of the beat is <beat-type>.
 <pre><time></pre>
          <beats>4</beats>
          <beat-type>4</beat-type>
          </time>

MEI
In MEI, The beat number is represented by the special <meterSig> element, the beat by count and the unit time value by unit.
 <meterSig xml:id="m2oykyy" count="4" unit="4" />
Conclusion
For the representation of the Time Signature, both software look similar, MEI looks more structured and does not take up too many lines.


Pitch
MusicXML
In MusicXML file, <step> representative name of pitch (e.g. C, D, E). <octave>: indicates the octave position.
<pitch>
          <step>B</step>
          <octave>4</octave>
          </pitch>

MEI
In MEI file,pname: Used to denote a phonetic name (the name of the letter of the pitch, e.g., ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’).oct: Used to indicate the octave of the pitch. accid: Used to indicate a change of notation (e.g. accid=‘s’ for ascending, accid=‘f’ for descending).
<note xml:id="n1d2lqsm" oct="5" pname="f" accid.ges="s" />
Conclusion
It's all full names in the XML file, which I think is better suited for music creators to get it done. Whereas MEI files with more specialised names are more suitable for programmers to work on.

Rhythm
MusicXML
In MusicXML, the rhythm is represented by the <duration> and <type> elements,<duration>: the basic unit of note duration.<type>: indicates the specific type of note
<duration>16</duration>
 <type>quarter</type>

MEI
In MEI, the tempo is represented by the dur attribute of the <note> element, which represents the time value of the note.
dur=‘4’: quarter note 
<chord xml:id="cjgm2z0" dur.ppq="16" dur="4" stem.dir="down">
Conclusion
XML files allow one to understand the meaning of element names at once, while MEI files are more convenient for editors to edit variables.


Chord elements
MusicXML
In MusicXML, each note of a chord is a separate <note> element, and each note element is marked as part of the chord by including a <chord> elemetn.
<note default-x="147.74" default-y="10">
        <chord/>
        <pitch>
          <step>A</step>
          <octave>5</octave>
          </pitch>
        <duration>16</duration>
        <voice>1</voice>
        <type>quarter</type>
        <stem>down</stem>
        <staff>1</staff>
        </note>

MEI
In MEI, the <chord> element directly contains all the notes within a chord, and the notes are represented as child of the <note> element.
 <chord xml:id="c67bph0" dur.ppq="16" dur="4" stem.dir="down">
                              <note xml:id="n1df6wvq" oct="3" pname="d" />
                              <note xml:id="n8kxs7w" oct="3" pname="f" accid.ges="s" />
                              <note xml:id="nqqbr16" oct="3" pname="a" />
                              <note xml:id="n1wc2nb6" oct="4" pname="d" />
                           </chord>
Conclusion
The MusicXML allows for more precise control down to the individual note, while the MEI looks more structurally workmanlike.
