Chord elements
MusicXML
In MusicXML, each note of a chord is a separate <note> element, and each note element is marked as part of the chord by including a <chord> elemetn.
<note default-x="147.74" default-y="10">
        <chord/>
        <pitch>
          <step>A</step>
          <octave>5</octave>
          </pitch>
        <duration>16</duration>
        <voice>1</voice>
        <type>quarter</type>
        <stem>down</stem>
        <staff>1</staff>
        </note>

MEI
In MEI, the <chord> element directly contains all the notes within a chord, and the notes are represented as child of the <note> element.
 <chord xml:id="c67bph0" dur.ppq="16" dur="4" stem.dir="down">
                              <note xml:id="n1df6wvq" oct="3" pname="d" />
                              <note xml:id="n8kxs7w" oct="3" pname="f" accid.ges="s" />
                              <note xml:id="nqqbr16" oct="3" pname="a" />
                              <note xml:id="n1wc2nb6" oct="4" pname="d" />
                           </chord>
Conclusion
The MusicXML allows for more precise control down to the individual note, while the MEI looks more structurally workmanlike.


Time Signature
MusicXML
In MusicXMLï¼Œthe beat number is represented in the <time> element, the number of beats per measure is represented by <beats> and the time value of the beat is <beat-type>.
 <time>
          <beats>4</beats>
          <beat-type>4</beat-type>
          </time>

MEI
In MEI, The beat number is represented by the special <meterSig> element, the beat by count and the unit time value by unit.
 <meterSig xml:id="m2oykyy" count="4" unit="4" />
Conclusion
For the representation of the Time Signature, both software look similar, MEI looks more structured and does not take up too many lines.


Pitch
MusicXML
In MusicXML file, <step> representative name of pitch (e.g. C, D, E). <octave>: indicates the octave position.
